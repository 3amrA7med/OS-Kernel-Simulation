# OS Kernel Simulation
A coursework project simulating the interactions between a kernel process, a disk manager process, and user processes using interprocess communication &amp; signals.


Requirements:
Unix system

Instructions:
1. Compile "process.cpp" and "disk.cpp" files using g++, name the outputs "process" and "disk" respectively.
2. Compile "kernel.cpp", put the compiled file in the same directiory as "process" and "disk" and run it.

* Several parameters such as the number of user processes to be spawned and the common name of the input files for the user processes can be modified through the defines at the top of kernel.cpp
